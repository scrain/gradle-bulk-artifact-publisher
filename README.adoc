= Gradle Maven Artifact Migrator

This is a quick and dirty Gradle project for publishing a large collection of existing artifacts into a target
repository.  I had access to the folder structure of an existing repo containing all the artifacts and POM files
and I needed them published into another repository.

== How it works
You configure `project.ext.sourceFolder` to point to a folder containing the existing POM files and artifacts and
the project recursively searches for POM files and artifacts to publish.  Because the search is recursive the target
folder can be the root of the repo or a folder of a specific artifact version.  For each POM file discovered, a
publication is configured using the Gradle `maven-publish` plugin.
